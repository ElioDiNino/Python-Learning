# Python Learning
This is a collection of the Python code I wrote for a high school programming class where we followed the lessons and tasks from [Program Arcade Games](http://programarcadegames.com/). At the end I also did a final project exploring machine learning using the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
